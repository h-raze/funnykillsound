## Known issues / FAQ:
```
- I've noticed that certain killsounds repeat a lot. Is the mod broken?
Since this pack contains so many sound effects, TF2 likes to only pick a certain amount. I'm fairly sure it stores these in a so-called 'pool'.
Right now I'm unsure of the specifics but I've noticed that sometimes only about 50 sound effects are selected from the pool, and keep repeating themselves. If you want to randomize the pool of active sounds, simply use the following command: record fix;stop;snd_restart;hud_reloadscheme. This command also fixes a lot of hud-errors, among other things. It's (in my opinion) pretty handy to have bound to a key. You can bind it to a key as well using bind key "record fix;stop;snd_restart;hud_reloadscheme".
